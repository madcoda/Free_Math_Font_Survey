This document is a survey of the free math fonts that are available
for use with TeX and LaTeX.  Examples are provided for each font,
links to where to obtain the font, and the commands for loading the
associated LaTeX package.

"Free" here means fonts that are free to use (both commercially and
non-commercially) and free to distribute, but not necessarily free to
modify. I also am biased towards listing fonts that have outline
versions in PostScript Type 1 format suitable for embedding in
Postscript PS or Adobe Acrobat PDF files.

The survey is available both as a PDF file and as a webpage.
